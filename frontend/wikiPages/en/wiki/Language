<h1>Language</h1>

<div class="content">

<p>Each of the four bibliographies uses its target language (Catalan, Spanish, Portuguese / Galician) not only for data but also for descriptive text. Similarly, each of the four bibliographies follows the bibliographical conventions peculiar to its own scholarly tradition.</p>

<p>However, in order to make PhiloBiblon as helpful as possible to the greatest number of users, all of the web pages have been made available in

Catalan, English, Galician, Portuguese, and Spanish.</p>

<p>PhiloBiblon uses the Unicode UTF-8 standard, as well as some

specialized encodings based on Unicode, both for the web version and the underlying Windows version.</p>
