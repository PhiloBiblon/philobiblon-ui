<p><i>BETA</i> is based upon and derived from <i>BOOST</i> (<i>Bibliography of Old

Spanish Texts</i>), originally compiled starting in 1974 as part of the

computer-assisted Dictionary of the Old Spanish Language project at the

Medieval Spanish Seminary of the University of Wisconsin, Madison. The

purpose of <i>BOOST</i> was to aid in the selection of the corpus upon which that

dictionary was to be based.</p>

<p><i>BETA</i> has evolved dramatically since 1974, both in purpose and in scope.

Like its congeners <i>BITAGAP, BITECA</i>, and <i>BIPA, BETA</i>'s purpose now is

nothing less than to provide a comprehensive union catalog of the primary sources,

manuscript and printed, for the study of medieval Spanish culture.

The original 966 entries of the first edition of <i>BOOST</i> (1975) have

expanded to the almost 30,000 of this new web version.</p>

<p><i>BETA</i> focuses on texts written in Castilian, but also includes materials

of cultural interest in <i>dialectos afines</i>: Leonese, Navarro, Aragonese, and

Mozarabic, as well as aljamiado materials in Hebrew or Arabic script in any of

these dialects. We define "cultural interest" broadly: all non-notarial texts

dealing with any subject matter whatsoever—e.g., history, law, science,

agriculture, theology, philosophy—as well as imaginative prose and poetry.

<p><b>Preferred citation form</b></p>

<p>Because <i>BETA</i> and its sister bibliographies attempt to identify specific

works, manuscripts, printed

editions, and individuals (authors, translators, copyists,

printers, owners, address…), we recommend that scholarly works

cite their identification numbers in order, for example, to

differentiate unambiguously between Íñigo López de Mendoza,

1st marquess of Santillana (bioid 1031) and his grandson and

homonym, Íñigo López de Mendoza y Luna,

3d marquess of Santillana and 2d duke of the Infantado (bioid 3034).</p>

<p><b>Conventions</b></p>

<p><b>Text-type / Texto-tipo:</b></p>

<p>The <i>texto-tipo</i> is the specific copy of a given work used to establish its

identity. I.e., when we refer to a copy of a work in a given manuscript or

printed edition as the <i>texto-tipo</i> for that work, we mean that this text as

found in this MS or printed edition is the touchstone to which all other copies

of the text should be compared. It does not necessarily mean that it is the

archetype, the oldest copy of the text, or the best copy of the text.</p>

<p>For example, there appear to be at least eight different

translations of the <i>Epistola de gubernatione rei familiaris</i> attributed to St. Bernard

of Clairvaux. The text-types for the three which follow are found in manuscripts

in the Escorial or the BNE:</p>

<ul style="color: #000; list-style-type: disc">

<li>Bernardus Claravallensis (pseudo). <i>Epístola de San Bernardo a

Raimundo, caballero, su sobrino</i>. (<i>BETA</i> texid 3758). Text-type in

San Lorenzo de El Escorial: Monasterio, K.III.7 (4), ff.

1r-4v (=238r-241v) (<i>BETA</i> manid 3614)</li><br>

<li>Bernardus Claravallensis (pseudo). <i>Carta de gobernación de la casa</i>

(<i>BETA</i> texid 4227). Text-type in Madrid: Nacional, 9247, ff.

117v-119v (<i>BETA</i> manid 2684)</li><br>

<li>Bernardus Claravallensis (pseudo). <i>Carta de san

Bernardo enviada a un noble caballero</i> (<i>BETA</i> texid 4229).

Text-type in Madrid: Nacional, 9428, ff. 29r-32r (<i>BETA</i> manid 3292)</li>

</ul>

<p>As other copies of the various translations are found, they can be grouped

together into families around the text-type.</p>

<p><b>Dates:</b></p>

<p>The dates found in the descriptions of manuscripts in

traditional printed catalogs (e.g., "s. XV in.," "middle of the 15th c.," "s. XV ex.") have been converted to numeric equivalents for the purposes of searching and sorting. Thus "s. XV in." becomes "1401-1410." However, this does not mean that a given manuscript was necessarily written between those two dates. The meaning is exactly that conveyed by "s. XV in." or "beginning of the 15th c."</p>

<p>The following equivalences use fifteenth century dates for illustrative purposes:</p>

<p>

1401-1500 = s. XV<br>

1401-1410 = s. XV in. (beg. of 15th c.)<br>

1401-1425 = s. XV<sup>1/4</sup> (1st quarter of 15th. c.)<br>

1401-1433 = s. XV<sup>1/3</sup> (1st third of 15th. c.)<br>

1401-1450 = s. XV<sup>1</sup> (1st half of 15th c.)<br>

1426-1450 = s. XV<sup>2/4</sup> (2d quarter of 15th. c.)<br>

1441-1460 = s. XV med.<br>

1451-1475 = s. XV<sup>3/4</sup> (3d quarter of 15th. c.)<br>

1451-1500 = s. XV<sup>2</sup> (2d half of 15th c.)<br>

1491-1500 = s. XV ex. (end of 15th c.)<br>

1491-1510 = s. XV ex. — s. XVI in. (end of the 15th c. or beg. of the 16th)<br>

1401-1600 = s. XV-XVI (15th or 16th c.). We attempt to avoid this; it is used primarily when "s. XV-XVI" is found in a secondary source.<br>

1500 ca. = around 1500<br>

1415 a quo = after 1415<br>

1415 ad quem = before 1415<br>

</p>

<p>Exact dates are expressed in Arabic numerals in the format YYYY-MM-DD, again for the purposes of sorting and searching. See the following examples:</p>

<p>

1463 = precisely dated on basis of colophon or other trustworthy evidence<br><br>

1463-03 = March 1463<br><br>

1463-03-08 = March 8, 1463<br><br>

1463 a quo — 1475 ad quem = between 1463 and 1475 (Dates that can be deduced, usually on the basis of internal evidence.)<br><br>

1406-12-31 a quo — 1423-09-18 ad quem = between December 31, 1406, and September 18, 1423. (Dates that can be deduced, usually on the basis of internal evidence.)<br><br>

1453 [?] = dated in 1453, but without certainty<br><br>

1453 [!] = dated erroneously in 1453<br><br>

1493 ca. [?] = dated around 1493, but without certainty. (Usually offered by one source but disputed by another.)<br><br>

1488-1491 [!], 1491 ca. [!], 1490 = MS or printed edition dated erroneously 1488-91 by one source, around 1491 by another, also erroneously, and correctly in 1490 by a third.

</p>

<p>The dates of both works and manuscripts have been established as precisely as

possible by comparative means as well. Thus the <i>terminus a quo</i> of a

manuscript can be set by the date of the latest work it contains; while the

<i>terminus ad quem</i> of a work can be set by the date of the earliest

manuscript that contains it or by internal documentation.

For example, the composition of Part IV of the <i>General estoria</i> of

Alfonso X must have been finished before the transcription of the

earliest MS that contains it, Vat. Urb. lat. 539 (1280) (BETA manid 1077);

while the copying of Part I of the same text in BNM 10236 (BETA manid 1059) must

have been finished before March 25, 1458, the date of death

of Íñígo López de Mendoza,

Marquess of Santillana, for whom it was transcribed.

Similarly, Gonzalo de Ocaña's translation of the <i>Diálogos</i>

of St. Gregory (BETA texid 1360) must have been finished before ca. 1460,

the date of death of Fernán Pérez de Guzmán,

to whom the translation was dedicated.</p>

<p><b>Madison</b></p>

<p>Since the Dictionary of the Old Spanish Language (DOSL) was conceived as a

citation-based lexicon, like the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> (<i>OED</i>),

Lloyd Kasten, its director, and John Nitti, associate director, realized that

they needed to seek those citations in authentic medieval texts produced prior

to 1500 rather than in modern editions, whose editorial criteria varied widely.

Thus the first edition of <i>BOOST</i> (1975), compiled in-house by Jean Gilkison

and Anthony Cárdenas under the supervision of Nitti,

included references only to manuscripts copied before 1501 or to incunabula,

i.e., printed editions prior to 1501. These were taken initially from the

first edition of the <i>Bibliografía de la literatura española</i>

of José Simón Díaz, whose volume on medieval literature

was published in 1953, and supplemented with references to the pre-1501

Escorial manuscripts taken from the Blessed Julián Zarco Cuevas'

<i>Catálogo de los manuscritos castellanos de la Real Biblioteca de

El Escorial</i> (1924-29), the first catalogue of medieval Spanish manuscripts

that merits the name, as well as the introductions to the various editions

of medieval Spanish works and other materials in the Seminary.

The sources of the second edition (1977) included the nine published

volumes of the <i>Inventario general de manuscritos de la Biblioteca Nacional</i>

(the only ones which had appeared to that time) as well.</p>

<p>For the technical history of <i>BOOST</i> and <i>BETA</i>, see the <i>PhiloBiblon</i>

Home Page.</p>

<p>The first edition of <i>BOOST</i> (1975) contained 966 entries, each one

listing a given text in a given manuscript or printed edition,

organized by author and title; the second edition (1977), organized the same

way, contained 1,869 entries. The third edition (1984), now under the

editorial control of a team of outside scholars (Charles Faulhaber, Ángel

Gómez Moreno, David Mackenzie, Brian Dutton),

contained 3,378 entries, organized topographically by city, library,

shelfmark, and folio order within a given volume.</p>

<p>Because <i>BOOST</i> no longer focused exclusively on providing support

for DOSL, one of the first decisions of the new editorial team was to include

manuscripts produced after 1501; although for purely practical reasons that

year remained the cut-off date for printed editions.</p>

<a name="berkeley"></a>

<p><b>Berkeley</b></p>

<p>In 1985 editorial and production work was centralized at Berkeley,

although the editorial team continued to collaborate closely with Madison's

Medieval Spanish Seminary. In 1987, thanks to a grant from IBM, <i>BOOST was</i>

ported from a main frame flat file database into Revelation (later Advanced

Revelation, from Revelation Technologies), a high-end, DOS-based relational

database management system.</p>

<p>In 1993 the DOS version of <i>PhiloBiblon</i>, with three of its component

bibliographies (<i>BETA, BITAGAP, BITECA</i>), was published on CD-ROM as part of

disk 0 of <i>ADMYTE</i> (<i>Archivo Digital de Manuscritos y Textos Españoles</i>),

produced by Micronet, S.A. (Madrid), with the support of the Biblioteca Nacional

and the Sociedad Estatal del Quinto Centenario and under the direction of

Francisco Marcos Marín in company with Faulhaber and Gómez Moreno.

A new, revised, and expanded edition of the DOS version was published on

CD-ROM in 1999 by The Bancroft Library. It is now out of print.</p>

<a name="changesovertime"></a>

<p><b>Changes over time</b></p>

<p>With the third edition of <i>BOOST</i> (1984), the original descriptions taken

from secondary sources were supplemented with additions based on first-hand

consultation of manuscripts by a large number of scholars, but especially by

the compilers of that edition; and <i>BOOST</i>'s scope was expanded radically.</p>

<p>Currently, all MSS of medieval Spanish works produced before 1800 are included,

with selected MSS from the 19th and even 20th centuries that may reflect

now-lost originals. As for printed books, some post-1501 editions have been

included, chiefly on the basis of F. J. Norton's fundamental <i>A Descriptive

Catalogue of Printing in Spain and Portugal 1501-1520</i> (Cambridge, 1978).

Increasingly we shall be able to take advantage of Julián

Martín Abad's even more important <i>Post-incunables ibéricos</i>

(Madrid: Ollero y Ramos, 2001; <i>Adenda</i>, 2007); although the

editorial team has still not been able to cull information from that

work systematically.</p>

<p>In the current database the Analytic table, which most closely corresponds to

the original organization of <i>BOOST</i>, since it also lists a given text in a

given manuscript or printed edition, contains 9,973 records as of March 1, 2011,

more than ten times as many as the 966 entries of the first edition.

The other tables in <i>BETA</i> contain another 20,000 records with detailed

descriptions of manuscripts and printed editions, works, persons,

reference works, and libraries.</p>

<p>As in any database project that has existed for over thirty years,

criteria for data entry have expanded as the evolving data base management

system has made it possible to capture more information. Thus, in the

earliest years, only information absolutely essential for the purposes of DOSL

was recorded: Author, Title, Present Location, Original Production Date,

Specific Production Date, and secondary bibliography. Over time it became

obvious that codicological and bibliographical data should be added in order to

support the Specific Production Date; and that incipits and explicits should be

added to help identify specific copies of a given work.</p>

<p>Most recently, the compilers of <i>BETA</i> have attempted to document

exhaustively every manuscript and every copy of every edition on the basis of

first-hand knowledge. Where it was not possible to examine the volume itself,

such information was added on the basis of trustworthy secondary sources.

Thus, during 2007-2008, the Zarco Cuevas catalog of the Spanish manuscripts

in the Escorial was systematically culled for all relevant information,

supplementing in exhaustive detail the original descriptions taken from it

in Madison for the first and second editions of <i>BOOST</i>.</p>

<p>Similarly, the transcriptions, e.g., of incipits and explicits of texts

found in a given manuscript, have been made more detailed.

Thus the absence of initial capital letters has been shown by placing them in

square brackets: [A]. The height of initials has also been indicated with a

superscript to show the number of lines they occupy: [A]<sup>6</sup> means that

the space for the missing initial "A" is six lines high.

Punctuation, omitted from the original transcriptions of incipits and explicits

because of its arbitrary use in modern editions, has been transcribed from the

originals. Line breaks have been shown in prose as well as in poetry.

These latter details are particularly important for printed texts, where they

frequently can be used to distinguish one edition from another.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it has not been possible to revise systematically all records to

upgrade them to the current standards. Thus in practice some descriptions will be

extremely detailed and explicit while most are still quite succinct.

Over time, as the editorial team examines every manuscript or printed volume <i>in situ</i>,

all descriptions will be upgraded to the current standard.

In the meantime, we shall be extremely grateful for additions and corrections

to our data. These should be sent to <a href="mailto:cfaulhab@library.berkeley.edu">Charles B. Faulhaber</a>.</p>

<a name="scopecontent"></a>

<p><b>Scope and content</b></p>

<p>The number of manuscripts described first hand has increased considerably.

The descriptions of those in the Hispanic Society of America have benefited from

Faulhaber's work there. The BNE has also been the object of numerous campaigns

to examine firsthand the almost inexhaustible wealth of its manuscript and

early printed book holdings These campaigns have been supplemented with

information taken from the detailed descriptions in volumes 1-9 of the <i>Inventario general de manuscritos de la Biblioteca Nacional</i>

(1953-70; MSS 1-3026) and from the summary descriptions in volumes 10-15

(1984-2001; MSS 3027-11.000). The descriptions in the five unpublished

volumes (MSS 11.001-12.981) were provided to us in machine-readable form

thanks to the generous support of Julián Martín Abad and his

staff in the Sala Cervantes, particularly Lourdes Alonso.

In addition, both Gómez Moreno and Faulhaber have systematically

reviewed the BNE's card files.</p>

<p>During the fall of 2006 the same scholars also examined

the manuscript holdings of the Biblioteca Histórica "Marqués de

Valdecilla" of the Universidad Complutense de Madrid as well as those of the

library of the Duchess of Alba in the Palacio de Liria.

Nevertheless, only about 1,000 of <i>BETA</i>'s more than 5,700 manuscripts or

copies of printed editions have been examined first-hand by the compilers.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the number of excellent published catalogs of medieval manuscripts

in Spanish libraries has increased dramatically over the last fifteen or

twenty years, for example: <i>Catálogo de manuscritos de la Real Academia

Española</i> (1991), <i>Catálogo de la Real Biblioteca. Manuscritos</i>

(1994-1997), <i>Catálogo de manuscritos de la Biblioteca Universitaria de

Salamanca</i> (1997-2002), and <i>Manuscritos españoles de la

Biblioteca Lázaro Galdiano</i> (1998). We have used all of these but

still have not been able to extract all of the information they contain:

<i>Falta de mano de obra</i>.</p>

<p>With regard to early printed texts, <i>BETA</i> attempts to record every copy of

every edition along with the condition and provenance of each copy.

The basic repertories of Spanish incunabula (Haebler 1903-17, Vindel 1945-51) have

been used but still not exhaustively <i>vaciados</i>. However, we have

systematically culled the <i>Catálogo general de incunables en

bibliotecas españolas</i> of Francisco García Craviotto and the

<i>Adiciones y correcciones</i> of Martín Abad. The major national

catalogs have been examined as well (e.g., Goff 1964, 1972 for the United States;

Pellechet for France), but not necessarily systematically. We have yet to

tackle the

<a href="http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/istc/index.html">Incunabula Short Title

Catalogue</a> maintained by the British Library. Essentially an international

electronic union catalog, it is intended to be a comprehensive listing of

all incunabula with locations of extant copies. However, it is still

very much a work <i>in fieri</i>; and, unlike <i>BETA</i>, it does not intend to

list every copy in a given library. BETA is also a work <i>in fieri</i>, but it

is already and will remain the enumerative and descriptive bibliography of

record for early printed books in Spanish.</p>

<p>Despite <i>BETA</i>'s more than thirty years of existence, it is clear that

much remains to be done, especially with regard to the detailed codicological

description of individual manuscripts, the transcription of incipits and

explicits, and the identification of anonymous works.</p>

<p>In addition to our work with texts, manuscripts, and printed editions,

we have also paid a great deal of attention to the prosopographical background

of medieval Spanish literature. For example, Perea Rodríguez's archival

research in Valencia has added an enormous amount of information about

the poets of the <i>Cancionero general</i> (1511), while the five volumes of

the <i>Diccionario de historia eclesiástica de España</i> (1972-75;

supl. 1987) have given us the names and dates of all of the

bishops of Castile and Leon from ca. 1200 to 1500 and essential biographical

information for the most important ones. The same work has provided

information on medieval monastic and military orders, individual monasteries, and

their leaders (abbots, priors, commanders).</p>

<p><i>BETA</i>'s reference bibliography does not attempt to provide

comprehensive access to studies on medieval Spanish literature, a function

carried out more than adequately by the <i>Boletín Bibliográfico

de la Asociación Hispánica de Literatura Medieval</i>. Rather

we focus on manuscript catalogs, codicological studies of individual

manuscripts, editions of texts, biographical studies, and similar works

rather than on critical studies of authors, texts, or genres.</p>

<p>In terms of subject areas and genres, we are confident that we have

identified most of the vernacular <i>fueros, cortes</i>, and other legal texts

on the basis of the 19th-c. editions of the Real Academia de la Historia and the

manuscripts in the Escorial, although numerous post-medieval witnesses remain

to be added. The listing of the major <i>cancionero</i> narrative poems is

virtually complete. The texts and witnesses of the vast majority of the

<i>cancionero</i> lyric still remain to be added, but scholars have access to

them thanks to Brian Dutton's monumental <i>El cancionero del siglo XV. c.

1360-1520</i>, especially as found in

<a href="http://cancionerovirtual.liv.ac.uk/main-page.htm">An Electronic

Corpus of 15th Century Castilian

Cancionero Manuscripts</a>, directed by Dorothy Severin at the

University of Liverpool. Nevertheless, incorporation of the medieval

lyric into <i>BETA</i> remains a major desideratum. The <i>jarchas</i>

present linguistic issues that we have preferred not to address

for the time being. (Nevertheless, the manuscripts in which they are

conserved have been well described by other scholars over the past

quarter of a century.) Except for witnesses that antedate 1501,

we have omitted the traditional lyric, collected systematically by

Margit Frenk in her <i>Nuevo corpus de la antigua lírica popular

hispánica (siglos XV a XVII)</i> (Mexico City: UNAM-Colegio de México-Fondo de Cultura

Económica, 2003), which spares us this task, and the <i>romancero</i>

(catalogued similarly by the Seminario Menéndez Pida).</p>

<a name="electronicresources"></a>

<p><b>Electronic resources</b></p>

<p>Increasingly we have been able to tap into a wellspring of electronic innovation on the web. One of the sea changes that has taken place

over the last fifteen years or so is the availability of web-based electronic

texts and editions. Thus we cite and provide links to the

electronic transcriptions and editions found

in <a href="http://parnaseo.uv.es/lemir.htm">LEMIR (Literatura

Española Medieval y Renacimiento)</a>.</p>

<p>Even more useful, for those careful scholars who do not trust any

transcription or edition, are the partial or complete electronic

facsimiles of both manuscripts and printed editions that are beginning to

become available on the web. Pioneer in this respect was <i>ADMYTE</i>,

whose 55,000 pages of texts and facsimiles, originally released on CD-ROM,

are now available on the web as a subscription

service (<a href="http://www.admyte.com/home.htm">http://www.admyte.com/home.htm)</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://biblioteca.ucm.es/foa/25889.php">Biblioteca Digital Dioscórides</a> of the Biblioteca

Histórica "Marqués de Valdecilla" of the Universidad

Complutense de Madrid was the first Spanish library to make facsimiles of its

important collection of medieval manuscripts and early printed books

systematically available.

One may cite such stunning pieces as the alfonsine royal scriptorium manuscript

of the <i>Libros del saber de astronomía</i>, BH MSS 156

(<i>BETA</i> manid 1091).</p>

<p>Other projects provide partial facsimiles. The <a href="http://bancroft.berkeley.edu/digitalscriptorium/">Digital Scriptorium</a>,

a collaborative project initiated in 1996 by Berkeley's Bancroft Library

and Columbia University, has became a visual union catalog of medieval

MSS in all western languages to ca. 1550. Currently it provides

descriptions and partial facsimiles at extremely high resolution

of 5,300 manuscripts from 27 American institutions.

Of these, sixty-three are in Spanish, including:</p>

<ul style="color: #000; list-style-type: disc">

<li>Fragments of the only known MS of <a href="http://ucblibrary4.berkeley.edu:8088/xtf22/search?smode=basic;rmode=digscript;text=amadis%20de%20gaula;docsPerPage=1;startDoc=1;fullview=yes">Amadís de Gaula</a>, from the

first quarter of the 15th c. (<i>BETA</i> manid 1182. Berkeley:

</ul>

<p>Work on <i>PhiloBiblon</i> has thrown increasingly into relief the imperative

necessity of adequate facsimiles, transcriptions, and editions of all

medieval texts. Up to two thirds of all medieval Spanish texts are found

in only <i>one</i> manuscript. If that manuscript is lost or destroyed

before the text can be copied in some form, then the text itself is

lost, and with it an irreplaceable element of medieval

Spanish culture. ¡Manos a la obra!</p>
