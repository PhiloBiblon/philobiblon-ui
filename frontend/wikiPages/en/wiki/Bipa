<p><b>Scope and Content</b><br>

Currently under construction, the <i>Bibliografía de la Poesía Áurea</i> (BIPA), or Bibliography of Spanish Golden Age Poetry, is a database of first lines of sixteenth-and seventeenth-century

Spanish verse found in manuscripts and printed sources.

The current version of BIPA is a partial and incomplete version mounted for testing purposes. Comments concerning functionality only should be forwarded to

<a href="mailto:Ralph.Difranco@du.edu">Ralph DiFranco</a></p>

<p>However, even this incomplete version of BIPA offers useful data concerning:

</p>

<p>

</p><ol>

<li>works of named poets</li>

<li>anonymous poetic texts</li>

<li>poetic works embedded in prose narratives of various sorts, and other poetic works</li>

<li>poems set to music in musical-poetic collections</li>

</ol>

<p></p>

<p><b>General Database Usage</b><br>

Once posted, <i>BIPA</i> will provide the first lines, basic information about the manuscripts and books, and information on the libraries that house these sources.  It also will include topographical indexes of each source, titles of poems, authors, up-to-date bibliography, and subject documentation, all cross-referenced to provide comprehensive control of this material. The first-line methodology that we employ to analyze and record the data is universally recognized for this type of bibliographical scholarship.</p>

<p><b>History of Project</b><br>

In 1993 we published the <i>Tabla de los principios de la poesía española, siglos XVI y XVII</i>, an inventory of 125 manuscript and printed sources of Spanish Golden Age Poetry. Prompted by the advantages of applying computer technology to the identification and organization of manuscript and printed material, we made the <i>Tabla</i> the basis for advancing the work of inventorying sources and texts in a digital format. The <i>Tabla</i> was digitized by electronically porting its contents and attendant data into <i>BIPA</i>. All the other <i>incipits</i> and data have been and continue to be  entered via keyboarding.</p>
