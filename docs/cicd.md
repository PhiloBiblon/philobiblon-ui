# CI/CD — GitHub Actions + GHCR

## Workflows

### `staging.yml` — triggers: push to `master` touching `backend/`, `frontend/` or the workflow file itself, manual

Pushes that only touch other paths (docs, wiki pages, agent config…) don't produce a deployable change — the images are built solely from `backend/` and `frontend/` — so no run is triggered and, consequently, no deploy notification is posted either.

1. Looks up the pull request associated with the pushed commit (`find-pr` job), if any.
2. Builds `philobiblon-ui-backend` and `philobiblon-ui-frontend` images (with layer cache via GitHub Actions cache).
3. Pushes to GHCR with two tags each: `main-{7-char SHA}` and `main-latest`.
4. Deploys to the staging server via SSH using `docker-compose.ui-dev.yml`.
5. On failure of the build or deploy step, posts a failure comment (`notify-failure` job) mentioning `vars.DEPLOY_NOTIFY_FAILURE_GITHUB_USER`, with the failed job(s) and a link to the workflow run — on the PR if one was found, otherwise as a comment on the commit itself.
6. Deletes old image versions, keeping the 5 most recent. Tags matching `^v` (production releases) are never deleted.

### `staging-deploy-notify-success.yml` — triggers: `workflow_run` (fires when `staging.yml` completes on `master`)

Posts the success notification. This is a **separate workflow**, not a job inside `staging.yml`, because `anthropics/claude-code-action@v1` (used here to write the deploy summary) does not support running under a `push`-triggered job — it only supports `issues`, `issue_comment`, `pull_request*`, `workflow_dispatch`, `repository_dispatch`, `schedule` and `workflow_run` events. Splitting it into a `workflow_run`-triggered workflow is the only way to use it for this notification.

1. If the `build-and-push` and `deploy` jobs of that `staging.yml` run didn't both succeed, this workflow does nothing (checked directly via the Actions API — independent of `cleanup`'s outcome, so a `cleanup`-only failure doesn't suppress the notification for a genuinely successful deploy).
2. Otherwise, looks up the pull request associated with the deployed commit (`find-pr` job, re-run here since it's a separate workflow run). If none is found, nothing is posted.
3. If found, posts a comment on it mentioning the GitHub author(s) of any issue(s) the PR references (`#123`-style patterns in its title/body), or `vars.DEPLOY_NOTIFY_SUCCESS_GITHUB_DEFAULT_USER` if none are linked — GitHub emails those users via its normal @mention notification, so no SMTP setup is needed. The comment body is an English summary and test plan written by Claude from the PR's title, body, comments and reviews, plus the description/comments of the linked issue(s). Comments from the `coderabbitai` bot are ignored. If the Claude step itself fails, a bare fallback comment (still mentioning the right user(s)) is posted instead, so a successful deploy is never silently unnotified.

### `production.yml` — triggers: push of a `v*` tag (e.g. `v1.2.3`), manual

1. Builds both images and pushes with tags `v1.2.3` and `latest`.
2. Deploys to the production server via SSH using `docker-compose.ui-fact.yml`.

## Deploy sequence

Both environments follow the same sequence on the server:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.ui-<env>.yml pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.ui-<env>.yml up -d
docker image prune -f
```

| Environment | Compose file |
|---|---|
| Staging | `docker-compose.ui-dev.yml` |
| Production | `docker-compose.ui-fact.yml` |

The compose files on the server must reference the GHCR images directly:
- Staging: `ghcr.io/philobiblon/philobiblon-ui-{backend,frontend}:main-latest`
- Production: `ghcr.io/philobiblon/philobiblon-ui-{backend,frontend}:latest`

## GitHub Environments

Secrets and variables are managed per environment at **Settings → Environments**.
Create two environments: `staging` and `production`, each with:

### Variables (`vars.*`) — visible, non-sensitive

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `BASE_URL` | Frontend base path (e.g. `/` or `/ui/`) — baked into the image at build time |
| `API_BASE_URL` | Backend API URL (e.g. `https://example.com/api/`) — baked into the image at build time |
| `DEPLOY_PATH` | Absolute path to the project on the server |
| `DEPLOY_NOTIFY_SUCCESS_GITHUB_DEFAULT_USER` | GitHub login mentioned in the PR comment on a successful staging deploy when the PR references no issue — staging only |
| `DEPLOY_NOTIFY_FAILURE_GITHUB_USER` | GitHub login mentioned in the PR/commit comment on a failed staging deploy — staging only |

### Secrets (`secrets.*`) — encrypted

| Secret | Description |
|---|---|
| `SSH_HOST` | Hostname or IP of the server |
| `SSH_USER` | SSH username |
| `SSH_KEY` | Private SSH key (RSA or Ed25519) |

`GITHUB_TOKEN` is provided automatically by GitHub Actions — no manual setup needed.
`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` is a repository-level secret (not per-environment), also used by `claude.yml` and `claude-code-review.yml`.

## Testing pipelines manually

Both workflows support `workflow_dispatch`, which allows triggering them manually without a push or tag:

1. Go to **Actions** in the GitHub repository
2. Select the workflow (`Staging` or `Production`)
3. Click **Run workflow** and select the branch

## Server prerequisites

The deploy path on each server must contain:
- `docker-compose.ui-dev.yml` (staging) or `docker-compose.ui-fact.yml` (production)
- `.env` with the runtime environment variables

The server user must be in the `docker` group (or have equivalent permission to run `docker compose`).

## GHCR image names

```
ghcr.io/philobiblon/philobiblon-ui-backend
ghcr.io/philobiblon/philobiblon-ui-frontend
```

Images in a public repository on GHCR are free to pull without authentication.
